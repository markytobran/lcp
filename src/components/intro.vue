    <h1>Hello {{firstName}}</h1>
    <p>For the purpose of this test you will be creating a simple loan application form for a mock company called LCP Loans. We have created some basic components to help get you started.</p>

    <p>The requirements for the application will be:</p>
    <ul style="font-weight:bold">
      <li>First Name - Validated with min 3 characters</li>
      <li>Last Name - Validated with min 3 characters</li>
      <li>Loan Amount - This should be a slider with the min as 0, max as £2500 and increment in steps of £100</li>
      <li>Repayment Period - This should be a slider with the min as 6 months, max 3 years and increment in steps of 6 months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon submitting the loan application, the form should be hidden and a new view should be shown which shows a summary of their agreement with their monthly repayments and the total amount repayable. To simplify this calculation just make the total amount repayable as 125% of the loan amount</p>
    <p>
      We have added Bootstrap to assist with the styling and would like it to look as professional as possible. You can include any additional libraries / frameworks / dependencies you wish. The documentation for the slider can be found here:

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The design / functionality of this UI will be as important as the javascript calculations so please try to showcase your creativity as much as possible. Usage of css/js animations are also encouraged where possible</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We would like to have this completed by {{submissionDate}}. When making changes the preview should update in realtime but you should always save your work often. Once you are happy with the result, do a final save and copy the link url. Please email this to me
